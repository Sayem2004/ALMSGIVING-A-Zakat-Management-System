Project Title: ALMSGIVING â€“ A Zakat Management System

Description:
Completed in August 2022, ALMSGIVING was my first university project. Though it was not a mandatory assignment, my team and I took the initiative to develop it out of curiosity and a desire to explore something new. The project focuses on Zakat Management, aiming to make the calculation and distribution process more efficient and user-friendly. It provides a structured system to help individuals determine their payable Zakat based on their assets and income.

Since this project was developed for learning and exploration, the code was not highly structured or refined, but it played a significant role in strengthening our understanding of programming concepts, problem-solving, and teamwork. Through this experience, we gained valuable insights into financial management systems and improved our technical skills, which will be beneficial for future projects. This project was just the beginning of our journey into software development, inspiring us to work on more impactful solutions in the future.
